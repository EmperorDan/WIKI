# CPD

CPD stands for continued professional development. This is the process of individuals looking at their work, skills, knowledge, and critically analysing themselves. It is done to learn from previous mistakes. And with the benefit of hindsight time, and money will be saved in the future. 

You should have documentation for all your work. You do this to build a portfolio, which will provide you evidence of your development. What you may need to work on, and or change. This insight is integral to improving your work, and proffesionalism. You can use your portfolio when applying for jobs. It will give them an honest look at your work, and also how you work. This portfolio will be a record of your achievements, and also evidence of your proffesionalism when dealing with clients.
