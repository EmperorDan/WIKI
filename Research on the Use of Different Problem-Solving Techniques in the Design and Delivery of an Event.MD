# Research on the Use of Different Problem-Solving Techniques in the Design and Delivery of an Event


## Identifying Problems
If you don't address problems you may have early in the development process, it can cause massive problems later on. It's important to be aware of your colleagues, and to respect their ideas. You show this respect by being able to critically, but constructively, evaluate eachothers work. Having an idea shot down without a valid reason is crushing, and it can demotivate someone. Without understanding why their idea is being overshadowed it may become personal for them. As the development process is stressful this added atop can create a hostile work environment.

## Defining Goals
Defining your goals early on is important. The reason for this is so that everything you do from the start has a clear direction. This decreases the chance having to make massive changes later on. As with any project you most likely won't have the time, or money to do said changes. These are personified by your 'Epics' and 'User Stories' which are what your user wants, and/or your desired goal.    

## Brainstorming
Brainstorming is a brilliant way of getting ideas on paper. A 'Brainstorm' usually start with a subject at the center which you categorically break down into smaller components, and repeat the process sequentially where needed. This process is benefitial as it allows you to digest a large subject in smaller peices. 

## Considering Alternatives
Brainstorming gives you a better perspective of what's required. You can list the negatives , the positives, note down ideas and as a team work out the next step. The thing to do next is to weigh the positive and negative impacts that those decisions will make, and whether they're worth pursuing. Often you will find the best ideas at the time fall short later on and its important to stay vigilant of this, and to change where/when necessary.

## Finding a Solution
Following on from the previous point. It is important to understand that the best option isn't always the best. It may just be the best one you've come up with so far. If you believe something can be done better, there is a large possibility that your right. To not pursue alternative solutions can cost you time, and money further along.

## Execute Solution
Once your groundwork has been established you should be confident in your end goal. Dont worry yourself with potential problems just follow your plan.

## Evaluation
This is the most important step regardless of whether you've achieved your goal or not. If you weren't successful then look at your mistakes, this is the best opportunity you have to learn valuable lessons. If you were successful there will still be things that you could improve in the future. All critism is good critism and if you internalise lessons learnt it will promote success later on.
