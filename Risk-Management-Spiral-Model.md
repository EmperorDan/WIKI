# How risk is managed in the Spiral model

### Description:
The spiral model is like the incremental model, but with more dedicated to risk analysis. The model follows four phases: Risk analysis, Engineering and evaluation. The project will go through these phases repeaetably in iterations (called spirals in this model). Every spiral builds off the base spiral.

The spiral model goes through each phase of develpoment, repeatively. This provides the opportunity to go back, and edit earlier implementations. 

The spiral model goes through a initial risk analysis:
- Identify risks threatening the project.
- Classifying risks into user interface, and, development risks.
- Decide upon the risks to handle through each phase. 

Understanding risks help developers understand whether implementing risk resolution techniques such as prototyping, and benchmarking is necessary. The spiral model aims at identifying and evaluating software project risks, and helps in reducing these risks and controlling project costs. Risk management in the spiral model distinguishes it amongst other process models, it guarantees that most risks are recognized much earlier than in other models. This is essential for larger projects that have produced functional software early. As it constantly allows for changes due to the periodic testing iterations. This allows for a more robust product as you have to constantly re-evaluate your own work.
