# How risk is managed in the Spiral model

### Description:
The spiral model is like the incremental risk driven model not to be used by smaller projects. This model generally requires expertise during the iterations. Which means the overall success depends on the risk analysis phase. Each iteration of the development process helps ellinminate risk which are considered conditions, or events that may prevent the product from meeting its goals. Within the spiral model risks are considered to range from trivial to fatal and its the task for the development team to identify and prioritise all possible risks in order of importance. Once completed the development team determine strategies that can be used to mitigate or overcome the risks. These changes can effect the phase of the project and may be repeated multiple times.

The spiral model goes through each phase of develpoment, repeatively. This provides the opportunity to go back, and edit earlier implementations. 

The spiral model goes through a initial risk analysis:
- Identify risks threatening the project.
- Classifying risks into user interface, and, development risks.
- Decide upon the risks to handle through each phase. 

Understanding risks help developers understand whether implementing risk resolution techniques such as prototyping, and benchmarking is necessary. The spiral model aims at identifying and evaluating software project risks, and helps in reducing these risks and controlling project costs. 

Risk management in the spiral model distinguishes it amongst other process models, it guarantees that most risks are recognized much earlier than in other models. This is essential for larger projects that have produced functional software early. As it gives them a greater ability to manage risks as they arise. As it constantly allows for changes due to the flexibility of the model. This allows for a more robust product, as you have to constantly re-evaluate your own work to progress.
