# How risk is managed in the Spiral model

### Description:
The spiral model is like the incremental model, but with more dedicated to risk analysis. The model follows four phases: Risk analysis, Engineering and evaluation. The project will go through these phases repeaetably in iterations (called spirals in this model). Every spiral builds off the base spiral.

The spiral model goes through each phase of develpoment, repeatively. This provides the opportunity to go back, and edit earlier implementations. 

The spiral model goes through a initial risk analysis:
- Identify risks threatening the project.
- Classifying risks into user interface, and, development risks.
- Decide upon the risks to handle through each phase. 

Understanding these risks help developers understand whether implementing risk resolution techniques such as prototyping, and benchmarking is nessasary. The spiral model aims at identifying and evaluating software project risks, and helps in reducing these risks and controlling project costs. Risk management in spiral distinguishes it amongst other process models, it guarantees that most risks are recognized much earlier than in other models.
