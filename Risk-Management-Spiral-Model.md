# How risk is managed in the Spiral model

### Description:
The spiral model is like the incremental model, but with more dedicated to risk analysis. The model follows four phases: Risk analysis, Engineering and evaluation. The project will go through these phases repeaetably in iterations (called spirals in this model). Every spiral builds off the base spiral.

The spiral model goes through each phase of develpoment, repeatively. This provides the opportunity to go back, and edit earlier implementations. 

The spiral model goes through a initial risk analysis:
- Identify risks threatening the project.
- Classifying risks into user interface, and, development risks.
- Decide upon the risks to handle through each phase. 

Understanding these risks help developers understand whether implementing risk resolution techniques such as prototyping, and benchmarking is nessasary. The spiral model aims at identifying and evaluating software project risks, and helps in reducing these risks and controlling project costs. Risk management in spiral distinguishes it amongst other process models, it guarantees that most risks are recognized much earlier than in other models.

The foresight gained through this document allows you to address problems before it becomes too late. It gives you an opportunity to change direction early in development, but only if its completely nessecary. This document gives you a better understanding of the costs that you may face. Having this information gives you the chance to re-think where you're dedicating your resources and whether or not you should re-evaluate.

With the information you gather you can, better, determine the success of your project. It's possible you'll discover your project is not desirable to your intended audience. This information can be painful to digest but is a good thing as you've encountered the problem before starting. This gives you time to alter or completely change your concept to fit better with user demands.
