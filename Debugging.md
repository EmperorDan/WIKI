# Debugging 

The debugging process is vital in creating a successful application. Problems are encountered reguarly during development. This means we need to find new, and more effective ways to guard against it. One such way is using a debugging tool. A Debugging tool is a computer program that tests, and debugs a target program. This method saves an incredible amount time and money. Human testing can take days, whereas using a debugging tool allows you to perform multiple tests in hours. Debugger programs are built to detect bugs, and show their position for resolution. 

Another way is to do the debugging yourself this can be time consuming, and is still open to human error. Programs are compiled and executed repeatively to detect issues in your code. This is the same thing being done by a debugger, but a debugger can perform this task alot faster. Some people prefer to debug without the use of a tool, and there is no right way its purely down to preference. 

I use the various debugging tools available within most IDE's. I like having my code on one side, and my console on another. This is so i can see the outcome of my coding automatically. This is a massive benefit as i dont waste time compiling separately, and if a problem occurs i can rectify it and test it almost automatically. The time saved using a good IDE is invaluable, and personally i wouldnt sacrifice the ease at this point.

# IDE
## Introduction
An IDE is essential when writing code 
## Features
Stores all your uploads, and also automatically saves your work.

Your work is saved in revisions. This means you can load previous states of your code. This is very useful for debugging, and experimenting, with your code. As it allows you to make changes without the risk of it breaking.

Features a wide range of computing languages.

The settings tab gives you customization options. You can change the appearance, and the layout of your UI. This is benefitial because everyone has a certain way they work.    

- This IDE made it very easy to upload external files. Incorporating the external file containing the library was integral to project 03. 
- When making a mistake, for example leaving out a "{", or A mispelling. Repl.it would alert me to it, and then show me the character(s) that needed reviewal. This was extremely helpful as it saves time.
- Uploading files to your program is a simple task. Just cllick on the add file button in the top left.
- Another benefit of repl.it is their websites UI. The code on the left side, and the console on the right. This makes testing my code easy, which is a benefit to my learning process.
