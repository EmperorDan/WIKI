# Debugging 

The debugging process is vital in creating a successful application. Problems are encountered reguarly during development. This means we need to find new, and more effective ways to guard against it. One such way is using a debugging tool. A Debugging tool is a computer program that tests, and debugs a target program. This method saves an incredible amount time and money. Human testing can take days, whereas using a debugging tool allows you to perform multiple tests in hours. Debugger programs are built to detect bugs, and show their position for resolution. 

Another way is to do the debugging yourself this can be time consuming, and is still open to human error. Programs are compiled and executed repeatively to detect issues in your code. This is the same thing being done by a debugger, but a debugger can perform this task alot faster. Some people prefer to debug without the use of a tool, and there is no right way its purely down to preference. 

I use the various debugging tools available within most IDE's. I like having my code on one side, and my console on another. This is so i can see the outcome of my coding automatically. This is a massive benefit as i dont waste time compiling separately, and if a problem occurs i can rectify it and test it almost automatically. The time saved using a good IDE is invaluable, and personally i wouldnt sacrifice the ease at this point.
