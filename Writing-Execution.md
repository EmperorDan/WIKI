# Writing, and execution of code 

## Process of writing, and execution of code

- You start with planning out what your going to do. This will usually involve a flowchart. When using this chart shapes represent functions, processes, elements, ect. You will join, with arrow pointers, these various shapes to show how your game will function.  
- Once you have decided upon the algorithm you will use, you must translate it to code. After doing this you must 

## Coding
- Keep programs and methods short and manageable.
- Use language-specific idioms.
- Use straightforward logic and flow-of-control.
- Avoid magic numbers (numbers other than âˆ’1, 0, 1, and 2); instead, give them meaningful symbolic names.
- Naming conventions. Here are some general principles when choosing names for your variables, methods, and classes.
- Use meaningful names that convey the purpose of the variable. Choose names that are easy to pronounce, and avoid cryptic abbreviations. For example, use wagePerHour or hourlyWage instead of wph. Use polygon instead of p or pgon.
- Be consistent.
- Name boolean variables and methods so that their meaning is unambiguous, e.g., isPrime or isEmpty() or contains().
- Use shorter names (e.g., i) for short-lived variables and loop-index variables. Use more descriptive names for variables that serve an important purpose.
- Avoid generic names like foo or tmp and meaningless names like fred. Use terminology from the application domain when possible.
- Name a constant by its meaning, not its value, e.g., name your variable DAYS_PER_WEEK instead of SEVEN.

## Commenting 
Programmers use comments to annotate a program and help the reader understand how, and why your program works. As a general rule, the code explains to the computer, and programmer, what is being done; the comments explain to the programmer why it is being done. Comments can appear anywhere within a program where whitespace is allowed. 

- An end-of-line comment begins with // (two forward slashes) and ends at the end of the line on which the forward slashes appear. Any text from the // to the end of the line is ignored.
- Block comments. A block comment begins with /* (a forward slash and asterisk) and ends with */ (asterisk and a forward slash). Any text between these delimiters (even if it spans multiple lines) is ignored.
 
There is no widely agreed upon set of rules. Good programmers write code that documents itself.
Make sure that comments agree with the code. Be careful to update the comments when you update the code.
Do not write comments that merely restate the code. Generally, comments should describe what or why you are doing something, rather than how.

## Execution
Execution in computer and software engineering is the process by which a computer or a virtual machine performs the instructions of a computer program. The instructions in the program trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine. Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions in the program.
