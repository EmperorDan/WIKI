- This IDE made it very easy to upload external files. Incorporating the external file containing the library was integral to project 03. 

- When making a mistake, for example leaving out a "{", or A mispelling. Repl.it would alert me to it, and then show me the character(s) that needed reviewal. This was extremely helpful as it saves time.
