The settings tab gives you customization options. You can change the appearance, and the layout of your UI. This is benefitial because everyone has a certain way they work. I prefer the dark theme coupled with the stacked layout, because its easier on my eyes.

- This IDE made it very easy to upload external files. Incorporating the external file containing the library was integral to project 03. 

- When making a mistake, for example leaving out a "{", or A mispelling. Repl.it would alert me to it, and then show me the character(s) that needed reviewal. This was extremely helpful as it saves time.

- Another benefit of repl.it is their websites UI. The code on the left side, and the console on the right. This makes testing my code easy, which is a benefit to my learning process.
