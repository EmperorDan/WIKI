# Feasibility Reports

## Desription:
A feasibility report is a study that you undertake to garner whether a plan is likely to succeed. Feasibility is the quantification of difficulty. Projects cost large amounts of money, and time. And because of this a feasibilty report is generally used to get the scope of the project. After this you should have a better idea of whether its possible, or not. Also of things you may need to change before starting. This will save on changes later on in development, which may not be possible, or expensive. People working with you will have more confidence in your idea, when it's been analysed with the feasibility report. Having a clearer picture of what you want creates good decision making.

## Requirement Gathering

When making a feasibility report you research the market. You gather information on what is selling, what people are interested in, and the direction the industry may be heading. Gathering such information can improve your work, and help you understand mistakes that may arise during development.

The foresight gained through this document allows you to address problems before it becomes too late. It gives you an opportunity to change direction early in development, but only if its completely necessary. This document gives you a better understanding of the costs that you may face. Having this information gives you the chance to re-think where you're dedicating your resources and whether or not you should re-evaluate.

With the information you gather you can, better, determine the success of your project. It's possible you'll discover your project is not desirable to your intended audience. This information can be painful to digest but is a good thing as you've encountered the problem before starting. This gives you time to alter or completely change your concept to fit better with user requirement.

## Components

### Project Scope

This is where you clarify what your idea is, fleshing it out as much as possible. Once you have a clearer idea of what your doing it'll be easier to identify possible futture issues. This will also give you confidence when something works. 

### Project analysis

Analysing your project reguarly will give you an idea of its strengths, and weaknesses. Anaylsis is most needed during the early stages to prevent runtime errors, and bugs. The benefit of this is that you have the opportunity to solve these problems, before they become unmanageable. This also saves you money as you avoid time consuming mistakes.

### Project requirements

Knowing your softwares requirements is important. You want to provide a clear definition of what they are, and why they're necessary to your project. This will help you weed out aspects that aren't required.

### Technical Feasibility

This is the part where you critically look at how your going to proceed in development. You need to find the most logical and benefitial route. When facing problems look into alternative ways to solve your issues. Following on from that you must be open to new ideas, and methods. 

### Project evaluation

You have to evaluate what the costs of your project are going to be. The equipment, time, and resources all cost money and you must decide whether the costs are worth the project. This is ineluctable considering how much is invested in projects: pyschologicaly and physically. Understanding this early on gives you the opportunity to edit your ideas.

### Project Review

All of this will be compiled into a feasibility report. The report will give you insight on your project, allowing you to make a well realised, and evidenced, decision.
