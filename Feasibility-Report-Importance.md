## Importance
Creating software is time consuming, and costs alot too. Before starting an idea, and potentially working on it for months. It would be smart to create a feasibility report to get a greater understanding of what your target auduence wants. Doing this will give you ideas on how to refine your idea, progress with it, or scrap it altogether. 

Feasibility studies are important because they force you consider the big picture first and then think in a top-down fashion. In this way, one or two general starter questions lead to a host of additional, more detailed questions that become increasingly narrower in focus as you get closer to reaching an ultimate answer. 

Feasibility studies offer you the chance to “get it right” before committing time, money and business resources to an idea that may not work in the way you originally planned, causing you to invest even more to correct flaws, remove limitations, and then simply try again.
