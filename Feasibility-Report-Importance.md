# Feasibility Reports

## Desription:
A feasibility report is a study that you undertake to garner whether a plan is likely to succeed.

## Importance

Feasibility is the quantification of difficulty. Projects cost large amounts of money, and time. And because of this a feasibilty report is generally used to get the scope of the project. After this you should have a better idea of whether its possible, or not. Also of things you may need to change before starting. This will save on changes later on in development, which may not be possible, or expensive. People working with you will have more confidence in your idea, when it's been analysed with the feasibility report. Having a clearer picture of what you want creates good decision making.

When making a feasibility report you research the market. You gather information on what is selling, what people are interested in, and the direction the industry may be heading. Gathering such information can improve your work, and help you understand mistakes that may arise during development.
